# StarBlock

Welcome to Star Block, this Github repository is what will eventually power the replacement for the current SMP. Much work needs to be done before we can even consider deploying. If you are interested in contributing to the project please DM me via discord or email me at contact@lordgrass.com

In order to contribute no requirements are needed other than a strong will to learn PHP if necessary.
